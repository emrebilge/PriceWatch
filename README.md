# pricewatch-app

Check out the project at https://pricewatch-app.vercel.app/

PriceWatch helps provide the lowest possible price for refurbished consumer goods across online shopping websites such as Amazon, Walmart, BestBuy, etc. It functions as a combination of popular product discount sharing websites such as Honey or Slickdeals (extensions that provide user-submitted coupons for specific products on official channels). Using the APIs of these retailers, we are getting data directly without the need of user input. This allows us to find thousands of deals simultaneously that users cannot find anywhere else, and always provide users with real-time alerts about price changes and opportunities to save money during their online shopping experience.
